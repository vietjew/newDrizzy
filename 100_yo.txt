don’t look at the calendar. Just keep celebrating every day
nobody else controls you
make time to cry
make yourself walk
I drink the faucet water
don’t just die all because you want to
think positive
don’t die too early
just keep going
there is no need to ever retire
science alone can’t help or cure people
don’t marry an older man, marry a younger one
you gotta have good genes
you gotta be lucky for 100 years
take naps every day
keep kosher
I take a drink of Scotch every day
mind your own business, and don’t eat junk food
do your thing no matter what
science alone can’t help
find a role model and aim to achieve even more
I try not to worry I just try to live
age is not a disease
when you laugh at yourself, you prevent others from laughing at you
I don’t care what you’re passionate about
enjoy good dreams
there are so many people who love me
if anybody is fussing, I’m gone
you can’t laugh and be angry
beat to your own drum
don’t analyze it, just do it
I detest hypocrisy and gossip
don’t be a cheapskate
don’t take vitamins
I dress up everyday and I don't wear blue jeans
make sure and moisturize
be nicer
fix washington
spend less time with your spouse
put your kids to work
ladies, never admit you were wrong
be stubborn
make your bed everyday
let your kids do what they want to do
make it through the year
never act your age
the use of vitamins? forget it
don’t look at the calendar
I make myself go out every day
sex is to be encouraged
choose the right parents
take time to mourn what you’ve lost
exercise every morning… I have a machine
